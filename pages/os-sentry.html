        The Irish Home
      </h3>
      <p class="walk_day-description">
        Sentry Hill, nestled in Newtownabbey, County Antrim, Northern Ireland, stands as a venerable testament to the
        region&apos;s past. Originally erected in the 19th century, this historic house has metamorphosed into a
        captivating
        museum, offering a captivating odyssey through the annals of local history. Its prominence lies in its enduring
        association with the McKinney family, stewards of the estate for generations.
        <br>
        The McKinneys&apos; narrative traces its roots back to 18th-century Scotland, with James McKenzie, a Highlander
        embroiled in the Jacobite Rising of 1715. Seeking refuge in Ireland in 1716 with his betrothed, Helen Campbell,
        their union faced familial resistance due to the Campbells&apos; allegiance to the Hanoverian cause. Despite
        challenges, the couple married in Carnmoney Presbyterian Church in 1717. Sentry Hill, however, didn&apos;t see
        McKinney occupancy until the 1780s when Andrew, their grandson, took residence.
        <br>
        This abode, once home to the McKinneys, served as a crucible for their societal and political influence. Today,
        as a museum, Sentry Hill reverently safeguards a trove of artifacts, documents, and memorabilia that echo the
        family&apos;s pursuits. Visitors are transported back to the 19th and early 20th centuries, gaining insights
        into the
        daily life of a Northern Irish middle-class family.
        <br>
        Furnished with an array of items — from furniture and books to photographs and personal effects — the museum's
        exhibits encapsulate the McKinney legacy. The meticulously maintained grounds enveloping Sentry Hill add to its
        historical ambiance, enhancing the immersive experience.

            Around Sentry Hill
          </h3>
          <span class="walk_subheading">07-Jul-2023</span>
          <p class="walk_day-description">
            Our adventure around Sentry Hill began with our arrival last night on a bus from Belfast, settling into the
            welcoming confines of the Corns Corner Hotel. The atmosphere in Newtownabbey was notably adorned with Union
            Jack flags in anticipation of the Orange Order Parade, a sight that left us feeling a bit uncertain about
            what lay ahead.
            <br>
            The following morning, we had a scheduled meeting with Wesley Bonar, the former curator of Sentry Hill. From
            the
            outset, Wesley Bonar proved to be not only extremely nice but also incredibly helpful, providing us with
            insights
            that would shape our day ahead.
            <br>
            Our first stop was at the new Presbyterian Church, where we learned about the remarkable William Fee
            McKinney, who dedicated an impressive 62 years as the Secretary of Carnmoney Congregation. The history
            surrounding the church and McKinney's role in it left a lasting impression, setting the tone for the
            historical richness that awaited us.
            <br>
            Our next destination was the old cemetery, a serene resting place for numerous members of the McKinney
            family. The gravestones told stories of lives lived and the legacies left behind, adding a poignant touch to
            our journey.
            <br>
            The highlight of our day was undoubtedly our visit to Sentry Hill Museum. The weather, fortunately, was on
            our side, providing the perfect backdrop for capturing memorable photos. The museum itself was a treasure
            trove of history, each exhibit unveiling a piece of the past that had shaped the community.
            <br>
            After a fulfilling exploration, we made our way back to the hotel, reflecting on the day&apos;s experiences.
            However, a surprising discovery awaited us - some of our British coins were no longer accepted in the local
            shops. This unexpected turn added a contemporary twist to our historical adventure, reminding us that even
            in the midst of exploring the past, the present has its own set of surprises.

          <p class="walk_day-description">
            Our second day at Sentry Hill began with a delightful morning tea in the charming company of Robin Dundee,
            the last living member of the McKinney family near the historic estate. Our hotel served as the perfect
            backdrop for this rendezvous, offering a cozy atmosphere that facilitated a meaningful connection with Robin
            Dundee
            <br>
            In spite of his age, Robin Dundee proved to be a source of boundless wit and charm. Engaging in conversation
            with him felt like turning the pages of a living history book. Through his vivid anecdotes, he painted a
            captivating picture of life around Sentry Hill, transporting us to a bygone era eternally preserved in his
            memories.
            <br>
            Post the engaging morning tea, we set out on a leisurely stroll towards Sentry Hill House. Upon our arrival,
            a team of exceptionally courteous staff greeted us, embodying the epitome of hospitality. Their warmth and
            enthusiasm to ensure our visit was memorable added an extra layer of enjoyment to our exploration. They
            directed our attention to an exhibition in the reception area, a gem we had overlooked the previous day,
            unraveling new layers of the estate's history and cultural significance.
            <br>
            As we meandered through the exhibition, the allure of capturing more photographs proved irresistible. Each
            frame became a storyteller, conveying a unique narrative of the heritage enveloping us. Sentry Hill House,
            steeped in history, gradually revealed its secrets, allowing us the privilege of witnessing its tales come
            to life.
            <br>
            Our departure from Sentry Hill was punctuated by the generosity of the staff, who gifted us books and
            postcards - a tangible link to the profound experience we had absorbed. These thoughtful mementos would
            serve
            as enduring reminders of the warmth and hospitality extended to us during our stay at Sentry Hill.
            <br>
            Leaving with a profound sense of fulfillment, we took a moment to reflect on the vibrant memories woven
            together on our second day. The fusion of insightful conversations with Robin Dundee, the welcoming ambiance
            of Sentry Hill House, and the generosity of the staff had crafted an unforgettable tapestry of experiences,
            leaving an indelible mark on our journey around this historical gem.
