        Finally in Greece
      </h3>
      <p class="walk_day-description">
        Our whole family is fascinated by Ancient Greece. For as long as we can remember reading stories linked to Greek
        mythology and enjoying movies associated with Greek legends was a treasured pastime. But yet only Fiona had been
        lucky enough to visit Greece in the past. So, as one can imagine, when the opportunity of visiting Greece
        presented itself to us we all got very excited. A few days in Athens, on the way to the family&apos;s Christmas
        in Gdynia (Poland), meant that finally we were able to see parts of world history with our own eyes. Little that
        we knew, not only did we manage to wander through ancient Athens, but thanks to the generous hospitality of
        Jurek and Poppy, we had the pleasure of visiting Corinth, Mycenae, Epidaurus (Ancient Theater of Asklepieion),
        Nafplion, Sounio (Temple of Poseidon). On top of it, we managed to squeeze a few walks along Voula Beach, enjoy
        panoramic views from the hills near Voula and to celebrate Dawid&apos;s acceptance to the School of Architecture
        in a local Greek Taverna. A very busy four days.

            Around Athens

          <p class="walk_day-description">
            The day in Greece started with a series of phone calls to check what was on strike. Rubbish collectors,
            school teachers and the ferries, it seemed. So any thoughts of a day trip to a Greek Island were put aside.
            Poppy dropped us off at the Piraeus metro station with comprehensive instructions on how to use Athen&apos;s
            public transport and what to concentrate on in our sightseeing. Athens is finally here. What a smorgasbord
            of options. Where to start? What to see? The obvious choice for us was to start our adventure with the walk
            to Acropolis to see the famous Parthenon, Old Temple of Athena, Odeon of Herodes Atticus, Theater of
            Dionysus and many, many other fascinating archeological remains. On the way down from the top of the
            Acropolis we stopped at the New Acropolis Museum. We loved their exhibits indicating that the illegally
            obtained originals are held in such and such museums and are waiting to be returned to Greece. After
            visiting the museum we visited Ancient Agora with its Temple of Hephaestus and Holy Church of the Holy
            Apostles of Solakis. We started to slow down. Too much excitement for one day, and we urgently needed some
            lunch. Fiona had a great idea to leave the tourist area and try some local eateries located on a side
            street. We managed to scoff two big trays of meat and chips, between the four of us, for a fraction of the
            cost on the main street. We loved the Greek street food but were struggling to finish it all. Just as we
            were almost finished, they generously added more food to our trays! Not wanting to be rude ( and it was
            really delicious) we only just managed to eat it all. Little did we know that we were expected to manage
            another big meal later that day, compliments of Poppy&apos;s delicious cooking.

          <p class="walk_day-description">
            We were told in the morning that today we were going to visit a few places outside Athens. In all that
            excitement we, or at least I, missed the names of those places. After an hour of driving and enjoying the
            Greek countryside we arrived at the Corinth Canal, one of the most important projects of modern Greece.
            Completed... 25 centuries after the conception of its idea. The next stopover was - the Archeological site
            of Mycenae with its Grave Circle, Cyclopean Walls, Lion Tholos Tomb and of course, Treasury of Atreus or
            Tomb of Agamemnon. Agamemnon, the king of Mycenae and leader of the Greek army in the Trojan War. Totally
            unreal. A quick visit to Nafplion, to see the 19th-century Fortress of Palamidi, helped us to realise what
            we had just seen at Mycenae. But Jurek had another surprise for the day. Epidaurus, famous for the Ancient
            Theater of Asclepieion and Ancient Stadium, constructed in the 5th century B.C. to host nude athletic games.
            On the way back to Athens we stopped at Isthmia to have a look at a truly unique submersible bridge.

            The original plan was to spend three days in Athens on our way to Poland through Munich in Germany.
            Fortunately for us, maybe not for our hosts, due to flight re-schedule we had gained an additional day in
            Greece. Our hosts decided that we would spend the morning in Athens and in the afternoon we would travel to
            the bottom of the Attica Peninsula. Once again, in the morning Poppy dropped us off at the Piraeus&apos;s
            metro station where we took the train to Athens to see more of the historical sites as well as some modern
            parts of the city. A must-visit to Hellenic Parliament took us much longer than planned. We watched the
            change of the Guard ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. Quite a fascinating spectacle. From
            Syntagma Square we walked Ermou Street towards the Ancient site of Kerameikos and the Roman Agora.<br>
            Early afternoon we travelled back to Piraeus to meet with Jurek who took us to Sounio. Cape Sounio is the
            southernmost tip of Attica and it is famous for: the Sanctuary of Poseidon, the Fortress and the Sanctuary
            of Athena.<br>
            After the sightseeing, we finished the day back in Piraeus, at the local Greek Tavern. It was our way to say
            thank you to Poppy, Jurek and Stefan for their great hospitality, as well as to celebrate Dawid&apos;s
            acceptance to the School of Architecture.

            Our last day in Athens was also very busy. In the morning Poppy took us to the surrounding hills for a
            relaxing walk. From the top of the hills, we were exposed to fantastic views. In the foreground, we could
            see the local suburbs, with some very impressive properties, and far in the background, the sea completed
            the picture. Later on, we went again to Athens to see Karameikos Cemetery and do some souvenir hunting in
            the proximity of Syntagma Square. Karameikos was a settlement of potters and vase painters, and the main
            production center of the famous Attic vases. The earliest tombs at the Kerameikos date from the Early Bronze
            Age. The cemetery was used incessantly from the Hellenistic period until the Early Christian period (338 BC
            until approximately the sixth century AD).<br>
            We couldn&apos;t leave Athens without a small collection of local memorabilia. Besides, just visiting the
            local shops is an attraction on its own. In the end, with a few miniature, fake paintings in our bags, we
            had to say<b> τα λέμε αργότερα </b> to the great city.
