        Why Taranaki?
      </h3>
      <p class="walk_day-description">
        It took us ages to get to this part of North Island. There was always something stopping us from visiting this
        region. Christmas with Fiona&apos;s family or holidays up north with friends were always good reasons. It was
        not until Dec 2017, when we went together to Yusuf (Cat Steven&apos;s) concert held at The Bowl in New Plymouth,
        that we became fully aware of the potential of the Naki.<br>
        So when the Tararua Tramping Club was organising a walking trip around Mount Taranaki we were the first ones to
        join the group. At the same time, we decided to extend this adventure with a few extra days around New Plymouth
        just to familiarise ourselves with the region. We took our time driving from home to Taranaki. We stopped for
        the morning tea at the Woolshed Cafe and again at the Mud Ducks Cafe in Whanganui for lunch. From Whanganui, we
        took the ocean scenic route. To actually see the ocean on this route we had to take multiple side roads leading
        to different beaches. After 20 years of hearing about the famous Pungarehu surf beach, I finally saw the place.
        It was calm as. Once in New Plymouth we easily located our rented accommodation, did some grocery shopping in
        the local supermarket, had dinner and enjoyed the evening.

            New Plymouth Coastal Walk
          </h3>

          <p class="walk_day-description">
            We had spent quite a long time the previous night trying to figure out if the 3 hours Coastal Walk was a
            one-way or return time for the trip. In the end, not being any wiser we decided to go all the way to the end
            of the walk and back. We started from Ngamotu Beach, situated at the bottom of Pioneer Rd, where we stayed
            while in New Plymouth and followed the Ocean View Parade to get to the beginning of the Coastal Walk (around
            the Lee Breakwater). We passed Todd Energy Aquatic Centre, The Wind Wand, the Surf Life Saving Club, and we
            walked along Fitzroy Beach. Once we reached the Waiwhakaiho Rivermouth we were welcomed by spectacular views
            of the Rewa Rewa Bridge. This unique structure was constructed in 2010 and it is perfectly positioned in
            front of Mount Taranaki. We were very lucky with the weather and our timing. With no one around the bridge,
            we were able to enjoy the views and take loads of photos. From the bridge, it took us another hour or maybe
            an hour and a half to walk to Tiromoana Crescent, Bell Block. After a lunch break, we started the return
            journey. And yes we discovered that the 3 hours was an estimate for the one-way trip, and maybe we were
            quite exhausted when we got back to our accommodation but was it worth it? Definitely yes. It is such a
            pleasant, flat walk with everything on the menu. We walked through parks, urban areas, beaches and rocky
            coast and we finished the day with fish and chips.

          <p class="walk_day-description">
            After the long Coastal Walk, the Opunake Walkway sounded like a perfect option for a more relaxing walk. We
            drove in the morning from New Plymouth to Opunake. We parked around Opunake Cottage Rest Home at the
            southern end of Opunake Beach and followed the well-marked track. The first stop of interest was Opunake
            Secret Cliff Top Garden, full of volunteers. The next stop was by Lion's Lookout from which we could view
            the Taranaki Bight. From there the track passes Middelton Bay and goes around Opakune Cemetery towards Te
            Namu Pa. Beyond the pa the track leads for some time behind dull industrial and urban areas. The better
            option is to go back to the starting point and walk around Opunake Lake and along the Waiaua River.

          <p class="walk_day-description">
            We said goodbye to New Plymouth and went on to further discoveries of the Taranaki region. The Three Sisters
            and The Elephant Rock were our next stops of interest. As we had some time to spare before the tide reached
            the lowest mark (the best time for getting close to the rock formations), we made a quick stop at Waitara
            Beach. Waitara Beach is a well-known Naki surf spot. The ocean was relatively calm but we managed to spot a
            couple of SUP-ers having a great time catching clean, long waves. From Waitara, it took us just under an
            hour to get to the Pilot Road car parking near Tongaporutu. From the car park, a short walk took us to the
            coast. We had no problem recognising the Elephant Rock. Although it lost its trunk to erosion a few years
            ago it still clearly resembles a huge elephant. It is a different story with the Three Sisters. An obvious
            choice were two distinguished, over 20 meters tall rocks looking very similar, but missing a third sister.
            And in the distance, at a certain angle, we could see another formation that looked like a group of three
            rocks. Later on, we discovered that only two of the Three Sisters still exist, so the first set was the real
            McCoy.

            From the coast, we drove inland on Okau Road and did a short walk to Damper Falls. The walk starts in
            farmland and leads through the bush to a couple of viewing platforms that allow you to see the falls in
            their entirety. At the other end, the Okau Road joins the Forgotten Highway. We took the right turn towards
            Stratford, stopping for a drink at the famous Whangamomona Hotel. That night we stayed at the Stratford
            Motel and Holiday Park where we met with the other members of the Tararua Tramping Club group. The following
            morning we drove to Konini Lodge in Egmont National Park. The Lodge surprised us with great facilities that
            included electricity, a heat pump, fridges, stoves, cooking equipment, crockery and utensils, showers and a
            drying room.

            Since we never walked in the Egmont National Park, we were very keen to see as much as possible in the next
            two days. The hike to Pouakai Hut and Pouakai Tarns sounded like a very good option for the introductory
            walk.<br>
            After breakfast, we drove to Mangorei Road carpark, at the start of Mangorei Track and started the 6
            kilometers uphill. Most of the track is a boardwalk which makes the walks much easier. This track is famous
            for panoramic views, but unfortunately, the rain and low clouds prevented us from enjoying those views. We
            stopped at Pouakai Hut for lunch and a short rest, before continuing up to Pouakai Tarns. Again due to wet
            weather, we had no chance to marvel at the well-known Pouakai Tarns reflections. Never mind, we have a solid
            case to visit the place again in the future. Walking down the track was probably not faster than going down
            as we had to pay attention to the wet boardwalk. After 5:30 hours we returned to the carpark tired but
            happy.

            Walking parts of the Around the Mountain Circuit and Dawson Falls Walking Track sounded like a good plan for
            the second day in Egmont National Park. The morning started with going up the Dawson Falls Track towards the
            Stradford Plateau Track. Both tracks are a part of the Around the Mountain Circuit and lead to Stratford
            Plateau Carparks situated on Pembroke Road. From the carpark we followed the Around the Mountain Circuit
            track through the lovely old bush, all way down to Waingongoro Hut. 5 minutes from the hut we crossed the
            Waingongoro Swingbridge which is 24 m above the Waingongoro Stream. Back on the track we went to see Dawson
            Falls. This 18m waterfall was named after Thomas Dawson, the first European to discover it in 1885. To
            Māori, the falls are known as Te Rere o Noke (the Falls of Noke), a Māori warrior who hid from his pursuers
            behind the falls. From there a short stroll on the Maiana Road took us back to the lodge.
