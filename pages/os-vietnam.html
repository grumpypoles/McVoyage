        Road to Viet Nam
      </h3>
      <p class="walk_day-description">
        Visiting Viet Nam had been high on Fiona&apos;s bucket list for years. After spending much of her life helping Southeast Asian refugees start fresh in new countries, it was finally time to explore their beautiful homeland. <br>
        As with most international trips, our journey started at an unholy hour to catch a flight to Ho Chi Minh City via Melbourne. The flight with Air Viet Nam turned out to be an adventure of its own. I managed to lose an earbud, sparking a small search party among the nearby rows, and Fiona had a battle of wills with the in-flight entertainment system. Thankfully, the crew rebooted the unit, my earbud was eventually rescued, and everything else—meals, cabin service—was pleasantly uneventful.<br>
        Landing in Ho Chi Minh City, we joined a long line of passengers waiting for border control to grant us entry into this vibrant paradise. Once we were through, luggage in hand, we met our tour representative and were whisked off to the hotel. By then, it was too late to exchange money, but we managed to sort out Vietnamese SIM cards—an experience that could fill a chapter in itself. It involved photos of our passports, faces, and a fair bit of patience, but the shop staff were incredibly kind, and we left with working phones in hand. Without any local currency, our first evening in Viet Nam was low-key. We enjoyed a couple of drinks at the hotel bar before calling it a night, ready to dive into the adventure ahead.

            Old Saigon
          </h3>
          <!-- <span class="walk_subheading">11-Jul-2023</span> -->
          <p class="walk_day-description">
            Ho Chi Minh City, formerly known as Saigon, is Viet Nam&apos;s largest city and a hub of culture and commerce. Its history dates back to the early Khmer period when it was part of their empire,
             and later to the 17th century when Vietnamese settlers began to transform it into a thriving trading port. Renamed Saigon in the 19th century, 
             it flourished under French colonial rule, earning the nickname "Pearl of the Far East" with its elegant architecture and bustling streets. 
             During the Viet Nam War, Saigon served as the capital of South Viet Nam, playing a pivotal role in the conflict. 
             After the war ended in 1975, the city was renamed Ho Chi Minh City in honor of the revolutionary leader, and it has since evolved into a dynamic metropolis blending rich history with rapid modernization.
            <br>
            Days in Asia start early, often with hearty breakfasts that keep hunger at bay until late afternoon. Fueled by fresh fruits, a mix of Asian dishes, and baked goods, 
            we set off from the hotel to explore District 1. Our first stops: <strong>Ben Thanh Market</strong> and a money exchange office. Getting there, however, was an initiation into Vietnam&apos;s 
            infamous scooter chaos—swarms of them on roads, sidewalks, and even crosswalks. 
            Navigating the madness was a crash course in staying calm amidst the buzz.
            <br>
            We eventually found the bank and secured some Vietnamese dong. The process mirrored our SIM card experience: passport photos, card copies, supervisor approvals—it&apos;s 
            just how things work, and you roll with it. As for Ben Thanh Market, it was more of a sensory overload than a treasure trove, with countless vendors eager to sell things we didn&apos;t really need.
            <br>
            From the market, we strolled toward the <strong>Ho Chi Minh Museum</strong> but ended up only seeing it from a bridge over the Saigon River. 
            Speaking of the river—it was low, drained in parts, and, to put it bluntly, quite stinky. We even witnessed a young man attempting to dump packages into the water. 
            His plan succeeded, but he slipped and joined the trash in the murky river, much to Fiona&apos;s bemusement.
            <br>
            We continued down the famous <strong>Nguyen Hue Street</strong>, admired the <strong>Opera House</strong>, and tried to glimpse the <strong>Cathedral of Notre Dame</strong>, which, 
            sadly, was wrapped in scaffolding. Luckily, the charming <strong>Book Street</strong> and the historic <strong>Central Post Office</strong> more than made up for the disappointment.
            <br>
            On our way back, we indulged in fresh mango from a local park, picked up some beers, and enjoyed a relaxing afternoon siesta. Feeling refreshed, 
            we headed out for dinner at <strong>Nha Hang Ngan</strong> around 5 PM. Their spring rolls—packed with flavorful meat—were hands down the best we&apos;ve ever had. 
            It was the perfect end to our first day in Ho Chi Minh City.

          <p class="walk_day-description">
            On day two in the city, we swapped sandals for walking shoes—blister prevention mode activated—and set out for the Independence Palace and Revolutionary Museum.
            <br>
            <strong>Independence Palace</strong>, also known as Reunification Palace, is a historic landmark in Ho Chi Minh City that played a pivotal role in Viet Nam&apos;s modern history. 
            Built in the 1960s as the residence of South Viet Nam&apos;s president, it became a symbol of the country&apos;s political struggles during the Viet Nam War. 
            The palace is most famous for the dramatic moment in 1975 when tanks crashed through its gates, signaling the end of the war and the reunification of Viet Nam. 
            Visitors can explore its well-preserved rooms, including the president&apos;s office and war command center, 
            as well as its rooftop helicopter pad and surrounding park featuring military relics like tanks and fighter planes.
            The surrounding park features two Vietnamese tanks from the 1970s and a small warplane used during the Viet Nam War. 
            Nearby, a colonial-style building houses a fascinating exhibition detailing Viet Nam&apos;s history, making it a highlight of the visit.
            <br>
            The Revolutionary Museum in Ho Chi Minh City, housed in a grand French colonial-era building, offers a glimpse into Viet Nam&apos;s tumultuous history
             and its struggle for independence. The museum&apos;s exhibits span from the anti-colonial resistance against the French to the Viet Nam War and the reunification of the country. 
             Artifacts on display include photographs, weapons, and documents that chronicle the revolutionary spirit of the Vietnamese people. 
             While the museum provides some interesting insights, its presentation and curation may feel dated to some visitors, making it a less essential stop compared to other historical sites in the city.
            <br>
            As it was getting close to the lunch time we decided to try highly recommended on media Banh Mi Huynh HOA on Le Thi Ring street. 
            A huge cue spilling on to the street was a sign that we managed to locate the right place, but at this same time was an indication of long wait. 
            After queing for about 20 minutes we discovered that we were in the wrong que. Facing to spend another hour waiting for the food in the heat of the day I just gave up. I don&apos;t think Fiona was very happy with me. 
            On a way back to the hotel we picked up a couple of Banh Mi from some local place and ate them in our hotel room.
            <br>
            In the evening we met our tour leader from <strong>Intrepid</strong> and were introduced to the other members of the tour. 
            The official part of the meeting took around 45 minutes and afterwards we all went to a nearby restaurant for the evening meal.

          <p class="walk_day-description">
            <strong>War Remnants Museum</strong> - The War Remnants Museum in Ho Chi Minh City is one of Viet Nam&apos;s most poignant attractions, offering an unflinching look at the impact of war on the nation 
            and its people. Located in a modest yet imposing building, the museum focuses heavily on the Viet Nam War, documenting the horrors of chemical warfare, the devastation of bombings, 
            and the resilience of the Vietnamese people. Stark photographs, military relics, and firsthand accounts are displayed, creating a deeply emotional experience. 
            However, the museum also covers earlier conflicts, including Viet Nam&apos;s fight against French colonists, illustrating the country&apos;s long struggle for independence.  
            <br>
            One of the most striking aspects of the museum is its role as an educational hub. On Sundays, it&apos;s not uncommon to see groups of Vietnamese schoolchildren touring the 
            exhibits with their teachers—a scene that might feel surprising to visitors from Western countries, 
            where such graphic depictions of war are rarely part of school outings. The presence of young students here underscores Viet Nam&apos;s commitment to remembering and learning from its past.  
            <br>
            Outside, the museum grounds feature an array of military hardware, including tanks, fighter planes, and helicopters. 
            These remnants serve as tangible reminders of the war&apos;s machinery, providing a stark contrast to the deeply personal stories told inside. 
            Despite its somber tone, the War Remnants Museum is a place of reflection and education, leaving a lasting impression on anyone seeking to understand Viet Nam&apos;s history and resilience.

          <strong>Cu Chi tunnels</strong>
          The Cu Chi Tunnels, located about 40 kilometers from Ho Chi Minh City, are an incredible testament to human ingenuity and resilience. These underground networks, 
          used by the Viet Cong during the Viet Nam War, were crucial for guerrilla warfare, serving as living quarters, supply routes, and hideouts. 
          Today, they offer visitors a chance to experience a piece of history—albeit in a much-sanitized version!  
          <br>
          Exploring the tunnels was both fascinating and a bit nerve-wracking. Crawling through the narrow passages gives you a glimpse of what life underground must have been like—dark, 
          cramped, and not for the claustrophobic. From our group, only Fiona braved the full length of one tunnel open to tourists. She emerged victorious and a bit dusty, earning well-deserved applause for her grit.  
          <br>
          Adding to the atmosphere is the constant echo of gunfire from the nearby shooting range. For a fee, visitors can try their hand at firing an AK-47 or a pistol. 
          The sound adds a surreal layer to the experience, a stark reminder of the tunnels&apos; wartime purpose.  
          <br>
          The site also includes displays of traps and other wartime artifacts, giving insight into the resourcefulness of the Viet Cong. Though a bit touristy in parts, 
          the Cu Chi Tunnels are a fascinating visit, offering a unique mix of history, challenge, and, in Fiona&apos;s case, triumph!

            Around Delta

          <!-- <span class="walk_subheading">04-Nov-2024 to 05-Nov-2024</span> -->
          <p class="walk_day-description">
            Our trip to the Mekong Delta, known as the &quot;rice bowl of Viet Nam&quot;s, was a delightful dive into rural life and rich traditions. 
            This lush, fertile region not only produces a significant portion of Viet Nam&apos;s rice but is also home to vibrant waterways, friendly locals, and unforgettable experiences.  
            <br>
            We began with a scenic drive towards the delta, stopping for a quick coffee at the Chau Thanh rest stop before boarding a riverboat in My Tho. 
            Gliding along the river, we stopped at the Thao Nguyen Orchid Garden, where we sampled local fruits, honey, and chocolate. Despite the tempting flavors, we felt a bit guilty for not buying 
            anything - New Zealand&apos;s strict agricultural restrictions made bringing them back impossible.  
            <br>
            Next, we visited a coconut candy factory, marveling at the variety of products made from this versatile fruit. From there, our first, in Viet Nam, ever tuk-tuk ride whisked us to a canal, 
            where we switched to a small rowing boat. Floating along the quiet waterways was serene and set the tone for our lunch at DNTN Nha Hang Song Nuoc Mien Tay, 
            a picturesque spot where hammocks invited an afternoon siesta. I couldn&apos;t resist trying frozen coconut coffee - a perfect, cooling treat in the tropical heat.  
            <br>
            After more tuk-tuk rides and a bus journey, we arrived at Ba Dany Homestay, a popular choice for travelers seeking an authentic and immersive experience in the Mekong Delta region of Viet Nam. 
            Located in Bến Tre, it offers a tranquil escape from the hustle and bustle of city life. The evening was all about relaxation, cooking spring rolls for dinner, and enjoying a lovely meal. 
            The highlight? An older Vietnamese lady using Google Translate to chat with Fiona - a heartwarming end to a delightful day in the delta.
          </p>

        </div>
        <p class="walk_day-description">
          After a hearty Asian breakfast, we settled our tab for the previous night&apos;s drinks and hopped into tuk-tuks waiting to whisk us off to our bus. 
          The short ride marked the beginning of our journey back to Ho Chi Minh City.  
          <br>
        En route to our hotel, we made a quick stop at the Central Post Office, an architectural masterpiece that blends French colonial elegance with Gothic charm. 
        Designed by Gustave Eiffel, the building&apos;s grand hall features vaulted ceilings, intricate ironwork, and a striking portrait of Ho Chi Minh. 
        It&apos;s a step back in time, and we enjoyed soaking in the historic atmosphere. Some visitors were busy sending postcards or shopping for souvenirs, 
        but we were content just marveling at the beauty of this iconic landmark.  
          <br>
          Just outside, we wandered through Book Street, a delightful pedestrian lane brimming with charm. Lined with vibrant bookshops and cozy cafes, 
          it&apos;s a paradise for book lovers. The stalls offered everything from classic novels to contemporary reads, and the laid-back vibe made it a lovely stroll.  
          <br>
          By lunchtime, we found ourselves at Pho 2000, a restaurant that&apos;s gained fame not just for its mouthwatering pho but also for hosting 
          former US President Bill Clinton in 2000. Located conveniently near Ben Thanh Market, it was the perfect spot to refuel. 
          The pho lived up to its reputation - rich, flavorful, and satisfying.  
          <br>
          After checking into our hotel, Fiona and I took some time to relax before heading out for a special names day dinner at Nha Hang Ngan. 
          The evening was a perfect blend of delicious food and good company, a wonderful way to wrap up the day.

            Flying from Ho Chi Minh City to Da Nang was an adventure in itself. Airports in Viet Nam are bustling, and while you&apos;re required to arrive hours 
            before departure, flights are often delayed due to a shortage of planes. 
            After showing our passports countless times, we finally boarded and were on our way.  
            <br>
            Da Nang greeted us with its unique mix of history and modernity. Once a pivotal American military base during the Viet Nam War, 
            the city housed one of Southeast Asia&apos;s largest airbases, complete with fortified runways and cutting-edge technology. 
            Today, while some remnants of that era remain, Da Nang has transformed into a vibrant coastal city, known for its sandy beaches, 
            cultural charm, and buzzing modern life.  
            <br>
            From Da Nang, we hopped on a bus to Hoi An, a town that feels like stepping into a storybook. This UNESCO World Heritage site is famous for its 
            beautifully preserved ancient streets, with influences from Vietnamese, Chinese, and Japanese cultures. Strolling past lantern-lit alleys, 
            historic temples, and colorful shophouses was enchanting. We stopped at a local spot for some incredible Banh Mi. 
            They were so good that most of us couldn&apos;t resist a second helping!  
            <br>
            Arriving at My Son Boutique Hoi An Hotel, we burst into laughter upon seeing our room. The &quot;full disclosure&quot; bathroom trend continued - 
            a glass wall separating it from the main room. After freshening up, an electric buggy whisked us to Hoi An&apos;s old city for a delightful 
            orientation walk and a delicious dinner at Green Mango Restaurant. It was the perfect introduction to this charming town.
          </p>

        </div>
        <p class="walk_day-description">
          The next morning&apos;s bicycle ride was one of the highlights of the trip. Pedaling along quiet alleys and lush rice fields, 
          we soaked in the serene countryside of Hoi An. Water buffalos grazed lazily, and graceful great egrets swooped over the fields, 
          creating a postcard-perfect scene. The ride included a fun stop for a spin in bamboo basket boats. 
          The local rowers added a lively twist by performing wild, K-pop-inspired dances while navigating the water. 
          To top it off, we enjoyed a refreshing coconut coffee at a charming riverside café, the perfect end to our idyllic morning in Hoi An&apos;s countryside.  
          <br>
          Later in the day, we joined a cooking class where we prepared our own dinner. It was a hands-on, laughter-filled experience, 
          and everyone seemed to enjoy the delicious rewards of their efforts.  
          <br>
          No trip to this region would be complete without visiting the <strong>My Son Sanctuary.</strong> Rising early—at an hour we&apos;d normally reserve 
          for sleep—we set off to explore this ancient treasure. Our guide, a South Vietnamese Army veteran, shared fascinating stories about the history of 
          My Son and his own life, which added a deeply personal touch to the experience.  
          <br>
          Arriving at the site before the crowds, we wandered among the ancient Hindu temples, marveling at their intricate carvings and timeless beauty. 
          Despite the damage inflicted during the Viet Nam War, the sanctuary still exudes a mystical charm. 
          A highlight of our visit was the traditional dance performance, a vibrant celebration of the Champa culture.  
          <br>
          Back in Hoi An, we had the afternoon to ourselves. A leisurely stroll led us to Orivy, a delightful spot where we enjoyed a simple, satisfying lunch.  
          <br>
          Our final dinner in Hoi An was at the Cargo Club Café and Restaurant. With stunning views of the lantern-lit river, 
          it was a magical way to say goodbye to this enchanting town.

          <!-- <span class="walk_subheading">15-Jul-2023</span> -->
          <p class="walk_day-description">
            Our four-hour bus journey from Hoi An to Hue, the former imperial capital of Vietnam, was an adventure in itself. 
            The route took us over the <strong>Hai Van Pass</strong>, also known as the &quot;Ocean Cloud Pass&quot;, a stunning mountain road famed for its breathtaking coastal views, 
            twisting turns, and historical significance. Our guide and bus driver, showing admirable nerve, paused on the winding road to let us snap photos of the 
            incredible scenery. Once across the pass, we stopped at The Lagoon Cafeteria for a short break, situated near a small beach where fishermen were busily 
            repairing their wooden boats. It was a perfect opportunity to capture some memorable snapshots of the journey.  
            <br>
            We arrived in Hue shortly after noon, just in time to enjoy a delicious lunch at the Golden Rice Restaurant. 
            Afterward, we checked into the Cherish Hotel, where a cold shower and a quick unpack set us up for the afternoon&apos;s highlight—the Royal Citadel.  
            <br>
            <strong>The Royal Citadel of Hue</strong> is a magnificent historical site that served as the imperial capital of the Nguyen Dynasty from 1802 to 1945. 
            This vast complex, surrounded by imposing walls and a moat, is a masterpiece of Vietnamese architecture with Chinese influences. 
            Highlights include the Forbidden Purple City, once reserved for the emperor, and various palaces, temples, and gardens. Though scarred by war, 
            ongoing restoration efforts have revived much of its former glory.  
            <br>
            While exploring the citadel, we were intrigued to see many Vietnamese tourists dressed in traditional costumes, posing for photographs 
            against the historic backdrop. Renting historical attire for photoshoots is a popular activity here, adding charm and vibrancy to the visit.  
            <br>
            We ended the day with a special treat—a home-cooked dinner at a private house hosted by a local family. 
            This intimate experience of authentic Vietnamese hospitality was a memorable way to close our first day in Hue.

          </p>

        <p class="walk_day-description">
          Fiona, our guide, and I started the day early, venturing out to try some local street food for breakfast. We sampled a regional specialty: 
          beef soup with vermicelli and a slice of black pudding. It was a bit unusual but definitely worth the experience.  
          <br>
          Our schedule was packed, beginning with a visit to the <strong>Mausoleum of Emperor Tu Duc</strong>, a breathtaking blend of imperial architecture and 
          serene natural beauty. Constructed between 1864 and 1867, this site was both a retreat and a final resting place for Emperor Tu Duc, 
          the longest-reigning monarch of the Nguyen Dynasty. Nestled in a lush pine forest, the complex reflects the emperor&apos;s love for poetry, art, and nature. 
          Remarkably, it served as his private retreat during his lifetime, while the location of his actual burial remains a mystery, shrouded in secrecy to prevent looting.  
          <br>
          Next, we visited <strong>Thien Mu Pagoda</strong>, or the Pagoda of the Celestial Lady, one of Hue&apos;s most iconic landmarks. 
          Perched along the Perfume River, this seven-story pagoda is steeped in history and spirituality. Founded in 1601 during the reign of the Nguyen Lords, 
          it is the oldest pagoda in Hue and holds deep significance for Vietnamese Buddhists. One particularly striking feature is the car on display, 
          which carried Thich Quang Duc to Saigon in 1963, where he famously immolated himself in protest against the persecution of Buddhists.  
          <br>
          On our way back to town, we enjoyed a peaceful vegetarian lunch at <strong>Quoc An Pagoda</strong>, a centuries-old center for Buddhist learning and devotion. 
          Its harmonious architecture, with intricate wooden carvings and serene courtyards, offered a calming ambiance and a spiritual highlight of the day.  
          <br>
          Although initially hesitant, Fiona and I decided to join an evening rickshaw ride. It turned out to be a fantastic experience, 
          combining the thrill of the ride with a visit to a fresh produce market—a vibrant, sensory-filled scene unlike anything we had encountered in Vietnam so far.

          <!-- <span class="walk_subheading">18-Jul-2023</span> -->
          <p class="walk_day-description">
            Our morning began with a bus ride to Phu Bai Airport, marking the start of our journey to Ha Noi. The usual delays and multiple security checks were a part of 
            the process, but eventually, we boarded our flight to Viet Nam&apos;s vibrant capital. Ha Noi is a city where tradition and modernity coexist in perfect harmony. 
            From its centuries-old architecture to its buzzing street life, it has a charm that captures the heart. The Old Quarter, with its narrow lanes, 
            contrasts beautifully with tranquil Hoan Kiem Lake and landmarks like the Temple of Literature and the Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum.
            <br>
            After landing, we headed straight to <strong>KOTO Restaurant</strong> for lunch. This wonderful initiative, started by a Vietnamese migrant, 
            provides hospitality training to street kids, giving them the tools for a better future. The food was delicious, and the service was impeccable - a testament to the program&apos;s success.
            <br>
            Post-lunch, we explored two of Ha Noi&apos;s most iconic landmarks. First, the <strong>Temple of Literature</strong>, a peaceful and historic site often regarded as Viet Nam&apos;s first university. 
            Built in 1070 and dedicated to Confucius, it served as a hub for learning and a tribute to scholars. Its traditional Vietnamese architecture, tranquil courtyards, and stone stelae honoring successful 
            royal exam graduates made for an inspiring visit. Next, we headed to the <strong>Ho Chi Minh Complex</strong>, a solemn and iconic tribute to Viet Nam&apos;s revolutionary leader. At its center is the Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum, 
            where his embalmed body rests in a glass coffin. The atmosphere is deeply respectful, with strict security measures and a dress code underscoring the site&apos;s significance. 
            Though we didn&apos;t see Ho Chi Minh himself, walking through Ba Dinh Square - a Vietnamese parallel to Moscow&apos;s Red Square - was an experience that brought history to life.
            <br>
            The evening was supposed to be free, but our generous guide surprised us with an outing to the famous <strong>Train Street</strong>. This narrow alley, lined with colorful houses and cozy cafes and bars, 
            has a railway track running right through it. Watching a train pass just inches away is thrilling, as locals calmly adjust their routines around the schedule. It&apos;s surreal and unforgettable, 
            though recent safety rules have tightened access. Sitting with a drinks, soaking in the scene, was an adventure in itself.
            <br>
            Before heading back to our hotel, we explored Ha Noi&apos;s <strong>Night Market</strong> in the bustling Old Quarter. The market, alive with energy, offered everything from souvenirs and clothing to 
            tantalizing street food. Bargaining added to the fun, and the vibrant atmosphere made it a must-see spot.
            <br>
            To cap off the day, we took a peaceful evening stroll along <strong>Hoan Kiem Lake</strong>. Its serene waters and softly lit surroundings provided the perfect contrast to the city&apos;s earlier hustle and bustle, 
            leading us back to our hotel with a sense of tranquility.

            A bit of relaxation
          </h3>
          <!-- <span class="walk_subheading">19-Jul-2023</span> -->
          <p class="walk_day-description">
            After over ten days of traveling across Viet Nam, with its rich history and countless cultural landmarks, our brains were starting to feel like overstuffed filing cabinets. 
            It was time for a change of pace — some relaxation, fresh air, and a closer connection to nature. Leaving Hanoi behind, we hopped on a bus and headed to the serene <strong>Van Long Nature Reserve</strong> in Ninh Binh 
            province. Known as &quot;the bay without waves&quot;, this tranquil destination is a vast wetland surrounded by striking limestone karsts. 
            The stillness of the water reflects the scenery like a mirror, creating a dreamlike atmosphere.  
            <br>
            We explored the reserve by sampan boats, gently paddling through quiet waters that carried us past caves, lush vegetation, and the occasional flutter of wildlife. 
            Van Long is home to the endangered Delacour&apos;s langur, though we didn&apos;t spot any during our visit. Fiona decided to give rowing a try and quickly got the hang of it, 
            proving she could master the art of sampan steering! It was a peaceful and calming interlude before diving back into Viet Nam&apos;s fascinating history.  
            <br>
            Our next stop was <strong>Hoa Lu</strong>, the ancient capital of Viet Nam during the Dinh and Early Le dynasties in the 10th and 11th centuries. Set against a backdrop of jagged limestone peaks 
            and verdant landscapes, this site is a blend of natural beauty and historical importance. We visited two beautifully preserved temples dedicated to Emperor Dinh Tien Hoang and Emperor Le Dai Hanh, 
            whose leadership helped unify Viet Nam and defend it from invasions. The temples, with their intricate carvings, statues, and historical relics, provided a serene and thought - provoking glimpse 
            into Viet Na&apos;s early dynastic history.
            <br>
            Lunch was a cozy affair at a local family home. Like many Vietnamese homes, it featured an altar for ancestor worship, complete with offerings and family portraits — a heartwarming tradition that 
            keeps the past alive.  
            <br>
            Our accommodation, the <strong>Tam Coc La Montagne Resort</strong>, turned out to be a trip highlight. Nestled amidst emerald - green hills, it offered a splendid pool, 
            cold drinks delivered to our loungers, and the perfect setting to unwind after a busy day of sightseeing. 
            <br>
            The next morning, we enjoyed a leisurely walk around a nearby lake, soaking in the peaceful neighborhood before heading to <strong>Thung Nham Ecotourism Zone</strong>.  
            Thung Nham&apos;s Bird Garden stole the show. Thousands of birds, from storks to herons, make this wetland their home. We took another boat ride, gliding quietly through the serene landscape to 
            watch birds returning to their nests at sunset — a truly magical sight. We also visited Hang But (Buddha Cave), with its intriguing rock formations, and Vai Gioi Cave, where stalactites create 
            an ethereal underground scene. Sadly, our boat rower seemed in a bit of a rush, so we missed photographing the bats hanging from the cave ceiling.  
            <br>
            The day wrapped up with an early dinner at a charming local restaurant, bringing a satisfying end to our time in this picturesque part of Vietnam.

          </h3>
          <!-- <span class="walk_subheading">15-Jul-2023</span> -->
          <p class="walk_day-description">
            After nearly four hours on the bus, we finally arrived at Ha Long Bay. The city itself felt oddly unfinished, with half-built developments dotting the landscape. Thankfully, our time there was brief. 
            We quickly boarded a charming, old wooden fishing boat that had been beautifully converted into a modern cruise vessel. Our cozy cabin was below deck, complete with a big bed, ensuite bathroom, 
            and air conditioning—perfect for a comfortable stay.
            <br>
            Refreshments awaited us on the upper sun deck, followed by a generous lunch to officially kick off our adventure. Soon, it was time to sail towards <strong>Ti Top Island</strong>, a true gem in the heart of Ha Long Bay. 
            This island, named after Soviet astronaut Ghermann Titov following his 1962 visit, is famous for its breathtaking panoramic views and pristine beach.  
            <br>
            The highlight of Ti Top Island is the climb to its peak. A staircase of about 400 steps winds its way up to an observation deck, offering spectacular 360-degree views of Ha Long Bay. 
            From the top, emerald waters and limestone karsts spread out like a dream. At 30°C, the climb was a sweaty endeavor, but the payoff was worth every step. The views were absolutely stunning — 
            only slightly marred by the sheer number of boats in the bay (including ours, of course).  
            <br>
            After soaking in the scenery, we descended to Ti Top Beach at the island&apos;s base. This crescent-shaped stretch of white sand is perfect for relaxing, and the calm, clear waters were 
            incredibly inviting. A refreshing swim was just what we needed to recover from the climb and prepare for the next adventure.
            <br>
            From the island, we sailed into a smaller bay, where kayaks awaited us. Paddling through the tranquil waters, surrounded by towering karsts, was a serene experience. 
            The sunset added a magical glow to the scene, making it an unforgettable highlight of the day.
            <br>
            As the sky darkened, we returned to the boat for pre-dinner drinks on the deck. Dinner itself was a feast, featuring fresh oysters and other mouthwatering dishes. For those feeling adventurous, 
            the evening ended with dancing under the stars—a perfect way to wind down our first day in Ha Long Bay.
          </p>

        </div>
        <p class="walk_day-description">
          Our final day of the tour dawned with a beautiful sunrise over Ha Long Bay, setting the perfect tone for the last leg of our adventure. After breakfast, we boarded a tender and made our way to 
          <strong>Sung Sot Cave</strong>, or the &quot;Surprising Cave&quot;, one of the most iconic and breathtaking attractions in the bay. Discovered by French explorers in 1901, Sung Sot Cave is located on 
          Bo Hon Island and is a must-see destination for anyone visiting Ha Long Bay. Reaching the cave involves a short but scenic climb up stone steps surrounded by lush greenery. 
          Once inside, we found ourselves in a cavernous space divided into two chambers. The first chamber, modest in size, has soft lighting that accentuates intricate stalactites and stalagmites, 
          offering a gentle introduction to what\&apos;s to come.  The second chamber, however, is where the cave earns its name. Immense and cathedral-like, it boasts towering ceilings and dramatic rock 
          formations that resemble everything from animals to mythical creatures. Enhanced by a mix of natural and artificial lighting, the space feels almost magical. A viewing platform within the cave 
          offers a stunning vista of Ha Long Bay, perfect for snapping a few memorable photos.  
          <br>
          Thanks to our guide, we were among the first visitors of the day. This allowed us to fully appreciate the cave&apos;s grandeur and take uninterrupted photos—a rare treat in such a popular spot.  
          <br>
          Back on the boat, it was time for breakfast, packing, and settling any bar tabs. With the cruise complete, we sailed back to shore and boarded our bus for the journey to Ha Noi. 
          Along the way, we stopped at <strong>Hong Ngoc Fine Arts</strong>, a workshop where people with disabilities create exquisite handcrafted items. Their artistry and skill were truly inspiring.  
          <br>
          Our last stop before returning to Ha Noi was at Mr. Liem&apos;s house. A world-renowned water puppetry artist, Mr. Liem has kept this unique Vietnamese art form alive. 
          Originating in the rice paddies of northern Vietnam during the 11th century, water puppetry involves wooden puppets performing on a stage of water, accompanied by traditional music. 
          Though Mr. Liem was away performing abroad, his wife and son graciously gave us a private performance. It was a fascinating glimpse into Viet Nam&apos;s rich cultural heritage.
          <br>
          The day ended with a farewell dinner, filled with laughter and reminiscence. Traveling with a group of strangers is always a gamble, but we were fortunate. Our shared humor and camaraderie made the 
          journey unforgettable, and much of that credit goes to our guide, whose warmth and energy brought us together.

            Beach Holiday
          </h3>
          <!-- <span class="walk_subheading">20-Jul-2023</span> -->
          <p class="walk_day-description">
            After finishing the Intrepid tour, we decided to linger in Hanoi for two more days. On weekends, the city becomes much more pedestrian-friendly as some of 
            the bustling roads near Hoan Kiem Lake are closed to vehicles. This transformation makes wandering around the area safer and more enjoyable. 
            Hoan Kiem Lake itself is a hive of activity, a true community hub. No matter the hour, you&apos;ll find locals practicing Tai Chi, dancing in groups, 
            walking, exercising, or even performing on stage. We spent plenty of time soaking up the vibrant atmosphere, watching life unfold around the lake.
            <br>
            Of course, we made a stop at the infamous <strong>Hỏa Lò Prison</strong>, grimly nicknamed the &quot;Hanoi Hilton&quot;. Built in 1896 during French colonial rule, 
            it was initially used to detain Vietnamese revolutionaries. Later, during the Viet Nam War, it housed American pilots shot down during bombing raids. 
            The stories within its walls left a lasting impression.  
            <br>
            Another highlight was the <strong>Vietnamese Women&apos;s Museum</strong>, a modern, beautifully curated tribute to the resilience and contributions of women throughout 
            Viet Nam&apos;s history. It offered a fascinating glimpse into the pivotal roles women have played, from warriors and resistance leaders to artists and 
            entrepreneurs. The exhibits were engaging and inspiring — a true celebration of strength and spirit.  
            <br>
            From Hanoi, we flew back to Ho Chi Minh City, where arranged transportation whisked us off to <strong>Bao Quynh Bungalow</strong> in Mui Ne. Here, we indulged in a 
            blissful seven days of relaxation, broken only by swims in the South China Sea and occasional excursions to nearby restaurants.  
            <br>
            Our accommodation was a dream. Our spacious bungalow sat a mere 10-15 meters from the sea, complete with private sun loungers and deck chairs where we 
            could observe the beach&apos;s lively happenings. Each morning, we woke just after 5 a.m. for a peaceful walk along the shore, followed by a refreshing swim. 
            Post-breakfast, our days unfolded with delightful monotony: reading, solving crosswords, swimming, and watching kitesurfers master (or attempt) their craft. 
            Oddly, we didn&apos;t spot any windsurfers.  
            <br>
            Mui Ne, amusingly, could easily be called &quot;Little Moscow&quot;. Most of the tourists were Russian, and the Cyrillic alphabet dominated the streets 
            more than Vietnamese signs. Menus in restaurants? All in Russian. It added a quirky twist to the otherwise serene vibe.  
            <br>
            After a week of beachside bliss, it was time to bid Vietnam farewell. We returned to Ho Chi Minh City and caught an Air Vietnam flight to Sydney, 
            where Fiona&apos;s sister welcomed us to a part of the city aptly named, believe it or not, <strong>Little Vietnam</strong>.
