        Getting There
      </h3>
      <p class="walk_day-description">
        Like all the Great Walks, the Lake Waikaremoana walk needs to be booked and pre-paid in
        advance with DOC. Getting to the lake is straightforward. We drove from Wainuiomata to
        Waikaremoana Motorcamp and spent a night in a spacious cabin. Getting to the track itself can
        be a hassle. The Water taxi service is not very reliable. In the end we used the <strong>38 Shuttle
          Service</strong> - an excellent choice. For $60.00 per person we were picked up from the Onepoto car
        park (where we would end our walk) and dropped off at the start of the track - the Swing
        Bridge near Hopuruahine Landing.

            Swing Bridge to Waiharuru Hut

          <p class="walk_day-description">
            It was our first multiday walk since the 1980s and we were not sure what to expect. Did we
            pack too much or not enough? Did we have the right gear? Did we bring everything? <br>
            Once we crossed the swing bridge all the doubts become unimportant. It felt good to be in the
            middle of Te Urewera National Park, the largest area of untouched natural wilderness
            remaining on the North Island. It was an easy/medium walk starting in the forest and following
            the lake edge for most of the morning. After 4 1/2 hours we reached the Waiharuru Hut, a very
            modern place with comfortable, semi-private bunks and a stand alone kitchen/dining block. As
            this hut is close to the start of the track many trampers chose to walk on to the next hut. We
            planned to stay in all of the huts, to make the most of our time in this beautiful area. There was
            a big group with a number of families with children of various ages who were on their last night
            having walked the track together. It was good to see the kids enjoying the track as much as we
            were. It gave you confidence for the future of tramping in NZ.

            We had a very short walk on the second day so were able to stop and swim at beaches on the
            way. The amazing late January weather around 29 to 30 degrees made swimming very inviting.
            Marauiti Hut is an older style hut where fewer trampers stayed. There was a very basic kitchen
            and a bunk room with a long bunk with a row of mattresses. As the first to arrive we claimed 2
            mattresses at one end next to the wall. We met here a pair of long distance runners who were on a mission to
            fast walk the whole track in two days.
            There was a good place to swim with big rocks to sit on while drying in the sun.
            In the morning you could see the mist moving across the water.

          <p class="walk_day-description">
            By far the most difficult and the longest day of the trip. It started with a long uphill just outside the
            Marauiti Hut and just went up and down, up and down. The track is covered in tree roots and we had to be
            very careful not to get hooked on them. A considerate owner of a private hut allows trampers to refill
            water bottles at the water tap. It was a saver on scorching summer days. Just before reaching the Korokoro
            campsite, we came across a well-marked track leading towards the Korokoro Falls. It is a 30 minutes one-way
            track. We left our backpacks in the bushes and embarked upon the venture. The rewards were great: a
            beautiful
            waterfall hidden deep into the forest and amazing views of the lake. At the Korokoro campsite, we met a
            small group of well-established campers. They had been coming to this spot for years. First as kids with
            their
            parents and now passing on their passion to the next generation. From there it took us over an hour to get
            to the Waiopaoa Hut.
            Waiopaoa Hut is flash, with easy access to the lake shore. We had a few swims before dinner and a nice chat
            with some Danes.

            The steep track gained around 500 meters, including multiple wooden steps. Challenging but
            not over the top. We learned a long time ago that &apos;constant slow&apos; works for us better than the
            &apos;fast and stop&apos; approach. Amazing views of the lake from the upper parts of the bushline were
            the highlights of the walk. After a relatively short walk on the top of the final ridge, we were
            pleasantly surprised by the appearance of the final sleeping place, the Panekire Hut, sooner
            than expected. Coming from the Waiopaoa side we arrived at the hut relatively early and were
            able to choose a couple of the bottom bunks. This hut is probably the oldest one on the track
            and one of the sleeping rooms includes three-tier bunks. Later trampers who had walked up the hill from
            Onepoto arrived at the hut looking totally exhausted. We were very glad we have opted for the anticlockwise
            option. Fiona followed the advice of another tramper and went on photo hunting opportunities. A
            short walk on the track we would walk the next day offered great views. It was a good decision,
            as the following morning low clouds covered the lake. The rest of the day/evening we spent
            basking in the sun at the top of the Panekire Bluff appreciating the glorious views, watching
            kids, and not only kids, throwing wooden sticks down the cliff so the sticks could be lifted by
            the air current and brought back near the hut. A fascinating, totally relaxing activity.

          <p class="walk_day-description">
            It was interesting to watch people at breakfast time. Those who climbed from the Onepoto
            Landing enjoyed fresh groceries and some of those who arrived from the opposite direction
            had run out of food. As we had carried extra Tararua Biscuits (Fiona&apos;s version of a NZ classic
            tramping recipe) we were able to help some of the less prepared ones. <br>
            After the initial wooden steps just outside the hut, the track followed the undulating ridge line
            and transformed into a long and steep descent ending at the Onepoto car park. The views
            photographed the day before were completely hidden by the mist. The highlight was walking
            through the ghostly mossy forest. Around the halfway mark we started to meet trampers just
            starting their adventure. Our light, half-empty backpacks were the envy of those struggling up
            the hill carrying heavy loads. When we arrived at the car park we were tired, happy and just in
            time to escape from the rain. We loved out first NZ Great Walk.
            Ready for the Abel Tasman.
