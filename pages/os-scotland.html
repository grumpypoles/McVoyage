        We arrived at the cultural centre of Scotland after a thirty-hour flight from New Zealand to Germany, with a
        layover in Frankfurt that lasted more than six hours. The Scots have concluded that I must be some sketchy guy
        attempting to bring extra batteries into their nation. They cut the luggage&apos;s locks and removed the
        offending item. We finally departed the airport and boarded a bus to the heart of the city. In close proximity
        to Edinburgh Old Town, we stayed at the Premier Inn at 82 Lauriston Place. We were so jet-lagged that straight
        after shower we went to bed and not even the
        saturday&apos;s revelers could keep us awake.

            An early breakfast that included many teas and black coffees got us ready for the day and helped with the
            jet lag issue. We were interested in knowing where the Rabbie&apos;s departure point was as we would be
            walking there the next morning for our bus excursion. Of course, we also wanted to visit as much of the
            historical Edinburgh as we could in a single day. To assist us with this task, we went on a free city tour,
            where you pay the guide what you believe is suitable at the conclusion of the walks. And indeed we managed
            to see a big part of old town.<br> While touring Greyfriars Kirkyard we learn about body snatchers and
            Greyfriars Bobby, a Skye Terrier who spent 14 years watching over his master&apos;s grave.
            We saw the Scott (Sir Walter Scott) Monument next to the Scottish National Museum, learned the meaning of
            the phrase &apos;Shit Face&apos;, and saw the Elephant House where J.K. Rowling composed the first draughts
            of Harry Potter. We indulged ourselves in delicious pulled pork sandwiches from Oink Hog Roast on Victoria
            Street. Some of us even had double pork crackling while others didn&apos;t. <br> We spent the majority of
            the afternoon surrounded by hundreds of fans watching the Riding of the Marches. The seven-hour trip from
            the Braid Hills to the city, terminating at the Mercat Cross on the Royal Mile, is a historic event dating
            back to the 16th century.

            <strong>Doune Castle</strong> - This morning, we met our tour leader and a group of friendly individuals
            from all over the world who were all eager to experience the Scottish Highlands and Islands. We left
            Edinburgh in a van driven by our tour guide. We were on our way to Doune Castle, our first stop.<br> Doune
            was the seat of Robert Stewart, the 1st Duke of Albany and Governor of Scotland. He acquired the castle in
            1361, when he married Margaret Graham, Countess of Menteith. Doune only officially became a royal castle
            after the death of both Albany and his son Murdoch, who was executed by James I on his return to Scotland in
            1424. Doune provided secure lodgings, but it seems neither as well organised nor as comfortable as Edinburgh
            Castle or Stirling Castle. Doune&apos;s role as royal retreat effectively came to an end in 1603, when James
            VI left for London, to become James I of England.

            <strong>Falls of Dochart</strong> - We stopped for morning tea at Callander, a little town near Doune.
            We bought some sausage rolls from the local bakery and went for a walk along the main, if not the only,
            street. <br>After a brief rest, we proceeded on to Killin, a little village in the Loch Lomond and The
            Trossachs National Park. The Falls of Dochart, a cascade of waterfalls, are famous in the area. The Dochart
            Bridge, built in 1760, spans the river at Killin, providing a view of the falls as they flow over the rocks
            and across the island of Inchbuie, the ancient burial place of the MacNab clan.<br> This location will be
            remembered not just for its beauty, but also for the worst cup of black coffee I've ever tasted.

            <strong>Loch Lomond</strong> - The National Park of Loch Lomond and The Trossachs was the next stop. It is a
            picturesque area located in
            central Scotland, known for its breathtaking landscapes, rugged mountains, and stunning lochs (lakes). It
            was established in 2002 and covers an area of approximately 1,865 square kilometers (720 square miles). The
            park is named after its two main features: Loch Lomond, which is the largest freshwater lake in mainland
            Britain, and the Trossachs, a scenic area of forests and glens. One of the highlights of Loch Lomond and The
            Trossachs National Park is the iconic Loch Lomond itself, with its stunning scenery and numerous islands.
            Visitors can enjoy boat cruises, kayaking, and hiking along the loch's shores, or simply take in the
            panoramic views from various viewpoints. The park is also known for its diverse wildlife, including red
            deer, ospreys, golden eagles, and many other bird species.

            <strong>Inveraray</strong> - We had our first Scottish pub meal at Inveraray&apos;s famed George Hotel. The
            George Hotel is a historic landmark located in Inveraray, a picturesque town in western Scotland. The hotel,
            which dates back to the 18th century, is renowned for its grandeur and rich history, making it a popular

            Archibald Campbell, the 3rd Duke of Argyll, and has been a
            prominent fixture in Inveraray ever since. The hotel's architecture is a fine example of Georgian style,
            with its elegant facade, tall windows, and ornate detailing.<br> Inveraray itself is a small town located in

            <strong>Inveraray Castle</strong> - The flag was up, indicating that the Duke of Argyll was at home, and we
            could only see the castle's exterior. It is the ancestral home of the Duke of Argyll and the seat of the
            Clan Campbell, one of the most prominent Scottish clans. Inveraray Castle is renowned for its beautiful
            architecture, stunning gardens, and rich history. Construction of Inveraray Castle began in 1746, and it was
            completed in the 1780s. The castle was designed by renowned architect Roger Morris and incorporates both
            Gothic and Palladian architectural styles, making it a unique and visually striking structure. It is built
            with greyish-blue stone quarried from nearby mountains, giving it a distinctive appearance. One of the
            highlights of Inveraray Castle is its extensive gardens and grounds. The castle is surrounded by picturesque
            gardens that include a walled garden, a woodland walk, and a fernery. The gardens are known for their beauty
            and are meticulously maintained, with carefully cultivated flowerbeds, tree-lined pathways, and stunning
            vistas of the surrounding countryside.

            <strong>Kilchurn Castle</strong> - We arrived at the Kilchurn Castle Viewpoint and Layby after a short ride
            and enjoyed a glimpse of the castle. Kilchurn Castle is a historic ruin located in the Highlands of
            Scotland, on the northeastern shore of Loch Awe. It is a picturesque castle that dates back to the 15th
            century and is known for its stunning setting amidst the Scottish landscape.<br> Kilchurn Castle was built
            by Sir Colin Campbell, the first Lord of Glenorchy, in the mid-15th century as a strategic stronghold for
            his clan. The castle was strategically positioned on a peninsula, which provided a defensible location with
            natural defenses on three sides, including the lake on one side and marshy ground on the other two sides.
            Over the centuries, Kilchurn Castle was expanded and modified by successive generations of the Campbell
            clan, and it served as a symbol of their power and influence in the region. The castle has a unique
            architecture, with a combination of medieval and Renaissance styles. It features a four-story tower house
            with a courtyard, along with various other buildings such as a chapel, a great hall,
            and a gatehouse. The castle was originally accessed by boat, and a drawbridge provided entry across the
            moat. Kilchurn Castle played a significant role in the history of Scotland, including the various conflicts
            between the Campbell clan and their rivals, as well as the larger political and military struggles in the
            region. However, by the 18th century, the castle had fallen into disrepair, and it was abandoned by the
            Campbells. Today, Kilchurn Castle is managed by Historic Environment Scotland, and it is open to visitors
            who can explore its ruins, learn about its history, and enjoy the stunning views of Loch Awe and the
            surrounding mountains. It is a popular tourist attraction and a favorite spot for photography enthusiasts
            due to its picturesque location and atmospheric ruins.

            <strong>St Conan&apos;s Kirk</strong> - Our final stop before arriving in Oban was a little chapel on the
            shores of Loch Awe. St Conan&apos;s Kirk is a unique and stunning example of Victorian Gothic architecture,
            designed by architect Walter Douglas Campbell and built between 1881 and 1930. St Conan&apos;s Kirk is known
            for its elaborate and intricate detailing, incorporating elements from various architectural styles, and its
            picturesque location overlooking the loch. One of the most striking features of St Conan&apos;s Kirk is its
            tower, which is modeled after the famous Holyrood Abbey in Edinburgh. The tower houses a working clock and a
            set of chimes that play a different tune every day of the week. The interior of the church is equally
            impressive, with beautiful stained glass windows, ornate woodwork, and decorative stone carvings.
            The church also has a number of interesting historical artifacts, including a replica of the famous Celtic
            Cross of Iona, as well as a marble baptismal font dating back to the 12th century. The churchyard contains
            the graves of several notable individuals, including members of the Campbell family, who were the patrons of
            the church.

            <strong>Oban</strong> - We were relieved to arrive at our B&amp;B, No17 The Promenade in Oban, after more
            than nine hours on the road and a distance of 277 km. Oban is located on the west coast of Scotland. It is
            situated on the shores of the Firth of Lorn, a narrow sea inlet, and is surrounded by beautiful hills and
            islands. It is a popular transportation hub, serving as a gateway to the Hebridean islands. It is known as
            the &apos;Gateway to the Isles&apos; due to its ferry connections to the islands of Mull, Coll, Tiree, and
            others. Oban also has a railway station that connects it to Glasgow and other parts of Scotland.<br> After
            taking a short look at our B&B accommodation, we went for a stroll around Oban's streets in search of a
            restaurant that served meals and beverages. We eventually enjoyed a supper and a few drinks at the Oban Inn
            before retiring to our lodgings and preparing for the next day&apos;s excursion.

            Keal, Loch Ba, and Loch Beg. The Three Lochs are three interconnected sea lochs located on the western coast
            of the Isle. These lochs are known for their scenic beauty, with rugged
            mountains, lush forests, and abundant wildlife. Loch na Keal is the largest of the three lochs and is home
            to various species of seals, otters, and seabirds.<br>
            The quickest method to go from Mull to Iona is to take a small boat from Fionnphort.
            <strong>Fionnphort</strong> is a small village located on the southwestern tip of the Isle of Mull. It
            serves as a popular gateway to the nearby Isle of Iona. Fionnphort is also known for its beautiful sandy
            beaches, rocky shores, and stunning views of the surrounding islands.<br>
            On our way back from Iona, just before boarding the ferry, we stopped at Duart Castle.
            <strong>Duart Castle</strong> is a historic castle located on the eastern coast of the Isle of Mull. It is
            one of the most
            iconic landmarks on the island and is known for its striking medieval architecture and stunning coastal
            location. Duart Castle dates back to the 13th century and has been the ancestral home of the Clan Maclean
            for centuries.

            <strong>Iona</strong> - Iona Island is a small island located off the west coast of Scotland, in the Inner
            Hebrides. It is known for its historical and spiritual significance, as well as its natural beauty.

            Iona Island has a rich history dating back to ancient times, with evidence of human occupation for thousands
            of years. In the 6th century, the island became an important center for Christianity when St. Columba, an
            Irish monk, established a monastery on Iona. The monastery, known as Iona Abbey, became a significant
            religious and cultural hub, producing important religious texts and spreading Christianity throughout
            Scotland and beyond.

            We traveled from Oban to Castle Stalker early in the morning. <strong>Castle Stalker</strong> is a
            picturesque castle located on a tidal islet in Loch Laich, near Appin. The castle is a four-story tower
            house, believed to have been built in the early 14th century by Clan MacDougall. It later passed into the
            ownership of Clan Stewart, and has been associated with several prominent Scottish families over the
            centuries. The castle has served various purposes throughout its history, including as a defensive
            structure, a hunting lodge, and a family residence. Next stop, Glen Coe. <strong>Glen Coe</strong> is
            a scenic valley
            located in the Scottish
            Highlands, often considered one of the most beautiful and iconic glens in Scotland.The glen has a rich
            history dating back thousands of years, with evidence of human habitation and
            activity in the area since prehistoric times. It is also associated with the infamous Glencoe Massacre,
            which occurred in 1692 when members of the MacDonald clan were massacred by soldiers loyal to the
            British Crown. We returned from the Coe to the <strong>Last Clansman Memorial</strong> and continued on our
            way to <strong>Port William</strong> and <strong>Inverlochy Castle</strong><br> We paused on the way down to
            the Shiel Bridge to photograph the <strong>Five Sisters of Kintail</strong>, a
            mountain range located in the Scottish Highlands. The range is known for its distinctive peaks that resemble
            five sisters standing side by side, hence the name "Five Sisters of Kintail".<br>
            We took the old <strong>Gleng-Isle of Skye Ferry</strong> to Skye Island. The Glenelg-Isle of Skye ferry is
            a small vehicle and passenger ferry that has been in operation for over 70 years, providing a unique and
            picturesque way to access the Isle of Skye. The ferry journey takes approximately 5-10 minutes, depending on
            weather conditions, just enough time to hear the famous tv license&apos;s inspector story, and provides an
            alternative route to Skye compared to the Skye Bridge. <br> The <strong>Slingachan Bridge</strong> was our
            final visit before arriving in Portree, the largest settlement on the Isle of Skye. Sligachan is a small
            settlement located in the central part of the Isle of Skye, known for its picturesque scenery and its
            historic Sligachan Bridge, which spans the River Sligachan. The area around Sligachan is known for its
            stunning landscapes, including the majestic peaks of the Cuillin Mountains, which are a popular destination
            for hikers and mountaineers. The magical waters by Sligachan Bridge refer to the river that flows underneath
            the bridge, which is believed by some to possess mystical or supernatural properties. According to local
            folklore, the waters of the River Sligachan are said to have healing properties and are associated with
            various legends and stories. One of the legends is that the waters of the River Sligachan have the power to
            grant wishes. It is said that if you make a wish while standing on the bridge and throw a stone into the
            river, your wish may come true. This is similar to the stone throwing tradition mentioned earlier, where
            visitors would skip stones across the water as a form of making wishes or blessings. Another belief
            associated with the magical waters of Sligachan Bridge is that they possess a rejuvenating or
            revitalizing quality. Some believe that splashing or immersing oneself in the river can have a purifying
            effect, revitalizing the mind, body, and spirit.
