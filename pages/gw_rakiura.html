        Getting There
      </h3>
      <p class="walk_day-description">
        It is quite a journey to get to Stewart/Rakiura Island from our place.
        Early in the morning, we drove to Wellington airport where we left our car at the long-term car parking area.
        From Wellington, we flew to Invercargill and from the Invercargill airport we were picked up by the shuttle bus
        and taken to the Bluff ferry terminal. Once in Bluff, we had some spare time on our hands, before the ferry
        departure, which we used to purchase a couple of gas bottles needed on the track for cooking. After an
        uneventful flight and shuttle ride, we were looking forward to our first time crossing Foveaux Strait. Due to a
        small, 1-meter swell in the strait, the skipper advised passengers to take the seats at the back of the ferry
        which would make the trip less bumpy. It took us an hour to reach Oban, the main settlement on the island with
        its famous South Sea Hotel.

            Oban to Port William Hut

          <p class="walk_day-description">
            According to DOC information, it takes 3-4 hours to reach Port William Hut from the end of Lee Bay Road.
            Many walkers use some sort of transportation to get themselves from Halfmoon Bay to the beginning of the
            track. We decided against it and we walked from Oban to Lee Bay Road. This way we had the opportunity to see
            parts of the island we would not experience if traveling by car, mainly Bathing Beach, Motoroa Moana Native
            Gardens and Horseshoe - Braggs Bay. The track to Port William very much resembles the Abel Tasman Track. It
            constantly switches between well-established walkways through New Zealand&apos;s beautiful bush and beach
            walks. Upon reaching the tip of Peters Point we walked down to Maori Beach. <br>
            Between 1913 and 1935 the Maori Beach area was a busy settlement with a sawmill.
            We took a quick look at the remains of the old equipment used by the mill (closed in 1931) and continued
            toward Magnetic Beach. An easy stroll along Maori Beach to the swinging bridge followed by climbing up
            forested ridges and a drop to the Port William Hut finalised our day one on the track.

          <p class="walk_day-description">
            We started the second day by retracing the last 45 minutes of our previous day's walk. The climb up seemed
            to be much quicker than anticipated. At the crossroads, we took the right turn, towards the well-signed
            posted Long Haulers (steam winches) left behind after milling ended. Before the trip, we had been reading a
            lot about the infamous mud on the track between Port William and North Arm Hut. We were well prepared for
            it, both physically and mentally. Luckily for us, even though the big parts of the track were muddy we did
            not encounter any seriously deep patches. It was hard work trying to stay clean and dry. A lot of our
            attention was dedicated to watching our steps instead of enjoying the surrounding bush. On this walk, we
            also learned the real meaning of the phrase &apos;undulating track&apos;. By the end of the day, it was a
            dirty phrase. The constant steps going up and steps going down made our day somewhat tiring. The halfway
            tree was marked with a fishing buoy. After almost 6 hours of slow walking the view of the North Arm Hut was
            a welcome sign.

            North Arm Hut to Oban
          </h3>

          <p class="walk_day-description">
            Back to the &apos;undulating track&apos; that follows the coast to the isolated bays, with the first
            stopover at Sawdust Bay. The place is located 1.5 hours from the North Arm hut and is well known as a great
            spot to watch birds feeding at low tide. After leaving the bay behind us we almost immediately stumbled upon
            an interesting formation of big boulders looking totally out of the ordinary, as they were dumped there by
            some giants and forgotten forever. Following another 60 minutes of ups and downs we reached Gallon&apos;s
            Sawmill, considered to be Rakiura Island&apos;s first sawmill. Unfortunately, the area is a part of private
            land with restricted access so we could not see any parts of the mill. For lunch, we stopped at Kaipipi Bay
            where we enjoyed the views across the waterway. From Kaipipi Bay the track transforms itself into a wide,
            well-maintained avenue. As it was still early we decided to extend our walking day by an extra couple of
            hours and return to Oban by Ryans Creek Track. An excellent decision. At the beginning the track winds
            through the forest but upon reaching the ocean it leads to Halfmoon Bay on high ridges along the shoreline
            providing fantastic views. The track finishes at the end of Thule Road and it took us another half an hour
            or so to get to our accommodation at Stewart Island Backpackers.
